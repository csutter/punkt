## Setup

‚ö†Ô∏è For workstation use, this repository is complemented by an additional private repository
containing restricted configuration and non-free assets (such as purchased fonts). Some
configuration in this repository may not work properly without `rcm` set up with both the public and
the private repository in `DOTFILES_DIRS`.
