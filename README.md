üìç My cross-environment dotfiles and documentation

## Setup

### On macOS

See [macOS setup documentation](_docs/macos_setup.md).

### On devcontainers

The `tag-devcontainer` tag provides an `install.sh` file which will should be configured in VS Code
as the devcontainer install script (alongside an install directory of `$HOME/dotfiles`). This will
set up `rcm` and other tooling, and set up the dotfiles.
