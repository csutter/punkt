	// user's home folder (which is shared across all GOV.UK Docker containers). This is fine as far
	// as the dotfiles are concerned (they only need to be symlinked once there anyway), but means
	// it doesn't run the install script again when a new container is opened. This means that the
	// extra packages my dotfiles install are missing in the container! To work around this, we
	// force the dotfiles install script to run on every attach. Not great, but does the job.
